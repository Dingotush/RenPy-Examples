# RenPy-Examples

This is the source and example running harness for the material presented at
[Developing with Ren'Py](https://wolfnose.org/renpy/index.html).

## Note:
The code contains both Ren'Py 7 / Python 2.7 and Ren'Py 8 / Python 3 examples.
Please be sure to search out lines marked `# Python 2` and `# Python 3` and
comment/un-comment for the version of Ren'Py you are using.

## Have at it:
These code samples are intended to be re-used and altered to suit your needs
in your own projects whether free or commercial.
They aren't intended to be complete solutions, only starting points.
You don't need to submit any changes you make back to this repository, or
make your own copied or altered source code available under similar terms.

## Attribution:
You are under no obligation to include attribution if you make use of these
examples, however it would be appreciated.

## Don't blame me:
These examples are intended primarily for the development of the web site linked
above. Some are examples of *what not to do*, or at least what to try and avoid.
And some deliberately *don't work*.
